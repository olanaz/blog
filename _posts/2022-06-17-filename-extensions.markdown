I have learned about file name extension.

filename extension is the name writen after the dot or at the end of a filename to help identify the type of file and which program to open it.

i learned that  if the filename extension is changed, the document will not open because it has been changed from the original file type into another one. It will only open if the filename is changed to its original name.

I also learned about different types of filename extension such as; jpg, jpeg, pdf, mp3, doc, html, txt etc.
